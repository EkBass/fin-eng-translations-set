The purpose of the project is to create the highest-quality translation database possible between Finnish and English.
The primary idea is to develop a linguistic database that can be used for training artificial intelligence, but all other kinds of use are also allowed and encouraged.
The project requires a significant amount of time, and creating and reviewing the first version took several weeks.

If you like to help, please let me know.
